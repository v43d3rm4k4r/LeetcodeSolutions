# LeetcodeSolutions
Repository for mastering Java, Kotlin and algorithms.
It is a tiny framework for running and testing specified solutions from leetcode.com. All the main components and some of the solutions itself are written in Java, but most of the solutions are written in Kotlin.

## Features:
- Concrete solution running (use `--run=N` arg, where N is problem ID);
- All solutions running (`--runAll`);
- Showing overall stats (`--stats`):  
    - Total solutions count;
    - Total solved problems difficulties;
    - The most frequent time & space solutions complexities (_Note that every problem can have multiple solutions_)
